# Hello Everyone

## This is a simple PDF Merger GUI made in Python, offline and uses only two external packages.

### I just wanted something simple to merge PDFs and also provide a gui so friends and family can use it who are not familiar with the command line.

#### requirements.txt (not needed if you use .exe)

- Python `3.9.13`
- Tcl `0.2`
- PyPDF2 `2.11.2`

#### How to use

- Download the .exe file from the releases page
- Run the .exe file
- Select the PDFs you want to merge in the order you want them to be merged
- Click Merge
- Clear the list if you want to merge more PDFs or messed up the order

#### Run with python

- Download the .py file from the releases page
- Install the requirements
- Run the .py file with ```python pdfmerger.py```
